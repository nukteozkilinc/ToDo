# ToDo

This application is a To-Do app designed to learn about the usage of tableview structure,MVVM and alerts. The tasks inside can be updated, and new tasks can be added. However, at this stage, the added and changed tasks are not displayed on the screen but are printed using the print() function. When the swipe-to-delete action is performed, the ID of the deleted row appears in the log, and an alert is shown to ask the user for confirmation before proceeding with the deletion.
